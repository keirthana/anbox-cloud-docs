# How to upgrade the Anbox Cloud Appliance

Before you upgrade the Anbox Cloud Appliance, make sure all packages on the machines that are part of the deployment are up-to-date. To do so, run the following commands on each machine:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo snap refresh

The Anbox Cloud Appliance includes an `upgrade` command which will perform all relevant upgrade steps to a newer version of the appliance.  First, run `anbox-cloud-appliance status` to check if an update is available:

    status: ready
    update-available: true
    reboot-needed: false
    version: 1.19.0

```{important}
While the upgrade process is active, API endpoints and the dashboard will not be available. Anbox Cloud instances will stay active and existing streams will also not be interrupted.
```

In the `anbox-cloud-appliance status` command output, the `update-available` field indicates if an update is available. If an update is available, the upgrade process can now be initiated by running the `upgrade` command:

    anbox-cloud-appliance upgrade

The appliance will now perform all necessary steps to upgrade to the newer available version. 

```{note}
In case automatic updates are disabled for applications, Anbox Management Service (AMS) cannot update the application. See {ref}`sec-configure-automatic-app-updates` to enable automatic updates or to manually update the applications.
```

You can watch the upgrade progress on the web interface:

 or with the same `anbox-cloud-appliance status` command that you used earlier:

    status: maintenance
    progress: 40
    update-available: false
    reboot-needed: true
    version: 1.19.1

When the upgrade is successful, the appliance is again available for regular use.

In case the upgrade fails due to a transient error or an issue with the system configuration, after resolving the issue, use the `--force` option to run the upgrade process again:

    anbox-cloud-appliance upgrade --force
