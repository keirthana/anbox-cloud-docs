  description: "The Anbox Management Service (AMS) external REST API is the REST API\
    \ used by\nall AMS clients. Note that internal endpoints are not included in this\n\
    documentation.\n\nThe AMS API is available over both a local unix+http and a remote\
    \ https API.\nAuthentication for local users relies on group membership and access\
    \ to the\nunix socket. For remote users, the default authentication method is\
    \ TLS client\ncertificates.\n\n## Authentication\n\nNot all REST API endpoints\
    \ require authentication, for example, the following API calls are allowed for\
    \ everyone:\n\n`GET /`\n`GET /1.0`\n`GET /1.0/version`\n\nSome endpoints require\
    \ an additional authentication token to ensure that the requester is authorised\
    \ to access the resource, for example:\n\n`GET /1.0/artifacts`\n`PATCH /1.0/instances/<name>`\n\
    \n## API versioning\n\nThe details of a version of the API can be retrieved using\
    \ `GET /<version>`. For example, `GET /1.0`.\n\nIf an API version is bumped to\
    \ a major version, it indicates that backward compatibility is affected.\n\nFeature\
    \ additions done without breaking backward compatibility only result in additions\
    \ to `api_extensions` which can be used by the client to check if a given feature\
    \ is supported by the server.\n\n## Return values\n\nThere are three standard\
    \ return types:\n\nStandard return value\nBackground operation\nError\n\n### Standard\
    \ return value\n\nFor a standard synchronous operation, the following dict is\
    \ returned:\n\n```json\n{\n\"type\": \"sync\",\n\"status\": \"Success\",\n\"status_code\"\
    : 200,\n\"metadata\": {}\n}\n```\n\nHTTP response status code is 200.\n\n### Background\
    \ operation\n\nWhen a request results in a background operation, the HTTP code\
    \ is set to 202 (Accepted) and the Location HTTP header is set to the operation\
    \ URL.\n\nThe response body is a dict with the following structure:\n\n```json\n\
    {\n\"type\": \"async\",\n\"status\": \"OK\",\n\"status_code\": 100,\n\"operation\"\
    : \"/1.0/containers/<id>\",\n\"metadata\": {}\n}\n```\n\nThe operation metadata\
    \ structure looks like:\n\n```json\n{\n\"id\": \"c6832c58-0867-467e-b245-2962d6527876\"\
    ,\n\"class\": \"task\",\n\"created_at\": \"2018-04-02T16:49:36.341463206+02:00\"\
    ,\n\"updated_at\": \"2018-04-02T16:49:36.341463206+02:00\",\n\"status\": \"Running\"\
    ,\n\"status_code\": 103,\n\"resources\": {\n\"containers\": [\n\"/1.0/containers/3apqo5te\"\
    \n]\n},\n\"metadata\": null,\n\"may_cancel\": false,\n\"err\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n\
    The body is mostly provided as a user friendly way of seeing what's going on without\
    \ having to pull the target operation, all information in the body can also be\
    \ retrieved from the background operation URL.\n\n### Error\n\nThere are various\
    \ situations in which something may immediately go wrong, in those cases, the\
    \ following return value is used:\n\n```json\n{\n\"type\": \"error\",\n\"error\"\
    : \"Failure\",\n\"error_code\": 400,\n\"metadata\": {}\n}\n```\n\nHTTP response\
    \ status code is one of 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 412 or 500.\n\n## Status codes\n\
    \nThe REST API often has to return status information, which could be the reason\
    \ for an error, the current state of an operation or the state of the various\
    \ resources it exports.\n\nTo make it simple to debug, there are two ways in which\
    \ such information is represented - a numeric representation of the state which\
    \ is guaranteed never to change and can be relied on by API clients and a text\
    \ version so that it is easier for people manually using the API to understand\
    \ better. In most cases, those will be called `status` and `status_code`, the\
    \ former being the user friendly string representation and the latter being the\
    \ fixed numeric value.\n\nThe codes are always 3 digits, with the following ranges:\n\
    \n100 to 199: resource state (started, stopped, ready, ...)\n200 to 399: positive\
    \ action result\n400 to 599: negative action result\n600 to 999: future use\n\n\
    ### List of current status codes\n\n Code  | Meaning |\n------|------ |\n 100\
    \   | Operation created |\n 101   | Started |\n 102   | Stopped |\n 103   | Running\
    \ |\n 104   | Cancelling |\n 105   | Pending |\n 106   | Starting |\n 107   |\
    \ Stopping |\n 108   | Aborting |\n 109   | Freezing |\n 110   | Frozen |\n 111\
    \   | Thawed |\n 200   | Success |\n 400   | Failure |\n 401   | Cancelled |\n\
    \n## Recursion\n\nTo optimise queries of large lists, recursion is implemented\
    \ for collections. A `recursion` argument can be passed to a GET query against\
    \ a collection.\n\nThe default value is 0 which means that collection member URLs\
    \ are returned. Setting it to 1 will have those URLs be replaced by the object\
    \ they point to (typically a dict).\n\nRecursion is implemented by simply replacing\
    \ any pointer to a job (URL) by the object itself.\n\n## Async operations\n\n\
    Any operation which take more than a second must be done in the background, returning\
    \ a background operation ID to the client. With this ID, the client is able to\
    \ either poll for a status update or wait for a notification using the long-poll\
    \ API.\n\n## Notifications\n\nA web-socket based API is available for notifications.\
    \ Different notification types exist to limit the traffic going to the client.\
    \ It is recommended that the client always subscribes to the *operations* notification\
    \ type before triggering remote operations so that it doesn't have to continually\
    \ poll for their status.\n\n## PUT vs PATCH\n\nPUT and PATCH APIs are supported\
    \ to modify existing objects.\n\nPUT replaces the entire object with a new definition,\
    \ it's typically called after the current object state was retrieved through GET.\n\
    \nTo avoid race conditions, the ETag header should be read from the GET response\
    \ and sent as If-Match for the PUT request. Doing so makes the request fail if\
    \ the object was modified between GET and PUT.\n\nPATCH can be used to modify\
    \ a single field inside an object by only specifying the property that you want\
    \ to change. To unset a key, setting it to empty will usually do the trick, but\
    \ there are cases where PATCH won't work and PUT needs to be used instead.\n\n\
    ## Authorisation\n\nSome operation may require a token to be included in the HTTP\
    \ Authorisation header even if the request is already authenticated using a trusted\
    \ certificate. If the token is not valid, the request is rejected by the server.\
    \ This ensures that only authorised clients can access those endpoints.\n\nAuthorization:\
    \ bearer <token>\n\n## File upload\n\nSome operations require uploading a payload.\
    \ To prevent the difficulties of handling multipart requests, a unique file is\
    \ uploaded and its bytes are included in the body of the request. The following\
    \ metadata associated with the file is included in extra HTTP headers:\n\nX-AMS-Fingerprint:\
    \ Fingerprint of the payload being added\nX-AMS-Request: Metadata for the payload.\
    \ This is a JSON, specific for the operation.\n\n## Instances and Containers\n\
    \nThe documentation shows paths such as `/1.0/instances/...`, which were introduced\
    \ with Anbox Cloud version 1.20.0. Older releases that supported only containers\
    \ and not virtual machines supply the exact same API at `/1.0/containers/...`.\n\
    \nAlthough deprecated, the `1.0/containers/...` API is still available for backward\
    \ compatibility."
