Anbox Cloud 1.24.0 is a minor release. To understand minor and patch releases, see [Release notes](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/release-notes/release-notes).

Please see [Component versions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/component-versions/) for a list of updated components.

## Requirements

See the [Requirements](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/requirements/) for details on general and deployment specific requirements to run Anbox Cloud.

## New features & improvements

### Updates to components

* Anbox Cloud includes and uses the following latest versions for components it uses:
  - LXC version 6.0.2<!--AC-2812-->
  - Mesa driver version 24.2.4<!--AC-2800-->
  - VirGL renderer version 1.9.0.<!--AC-2800-->

### Security

* We have enhanced security with a minimum version of TLS 1.3 as a requirement for all services working with Anbox Cloud. TLS 1.3 is also enabled by default for the Anbox Stream Agent and Gateway.<!--AC-2728 and AC-2654-->

### Anbox Management Service (AMS)

* We have increased the maximum number of queued operations in AMS to allow better performance.<!--AC-2831-->
* AMS supports querying the image variant (`android` or `aaos`) for Anbox Cloud images.<!--AC-2757-->
* The web client, for example, the Anbox Cloud dashboard can communicate with multiple AMS instances.<!--AC-2674-->

### Android

* This release includes Android 14 based AOSP and AAOS images.
* We now support using the lock screen in Anbox Cloud([LP 1983426](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/1983426)).

### Charms

* For the NFS Operator charm for Anbox Cloud, `Cachefilesd` is now optional and is used only when `fsc` is provided as a mount option.<!--AC-2839-->

### Dashboard

* You can now debug a session with the new developer tools on the stream page. Terminal and logs are available in parallel when streaming an instance.
* For mobile streams, a location selector is now available.
* For increased security, HTTPS is mandatory for all connections.
* Image type is auto-detected once application is selected. 
* Improved accessibility with a *Skip to content* button.

### Streaming

* Anbox Cloud now provides an option to allow the use of custom fragment shader-based upscaling algorithms for video streaming. This helps you to apply multiple shaders sequentially to perform multi-pass upscaling and replaces the default [AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0](https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-superresolution/) shader. See {ref}`sec-custom-fragment-shader` for more information.<!--AC-2541-->
* The Anbox Streaming SDK now includes two additional examples that demonstrate shader-based upscaling algorithms integrated with the JS SDK:<!--AC-2543-->
  - [Snapdragon™ Game Super Resolution(SGSR)](https://github.com/SnapdragonStudios/snapdragon-gsr)
  - [Anime4K high-quality real-time anime](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K)

### Other

* Android security updates for November 2024 (see [Android Security Bulletin - November 2024](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-11-01) for more information).
* The Android WebView has been updated to 130.0.6723.73.

## Removed functionality

Following deprecation in earlier releases, these functionalities have been removed from Anbox Cloud with the 1.24.0 release:

* Support for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)

## Deprecations

< List deprecated features. Provide an alternative, if any, for the users to use instead of the deprecated features >

## Known issues

* Out of band support does not work as expected for Android 14 images because of a change in implicit intents feature in the upstream.<!--AC-2852-->
* The following features can be enabled for AAOS images based on Android 14. However, this is not supported and may result in unexpected behaviour. This will be removed in the next patch release:<!--AC-2848-->
  - `enable_virtual_keyboard`
  - `enable_system_ui`
  - `enable_anbox_ime`
  - Custom Android ID
  - Custom system apps
  - Boot package support

## Bug fixes

The following bugs have been fixed as part of the Anbox Cloud 1.24.0 release.

* [LP 2064900](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2064900) If an instance fails and ends up with *Error* status, the session for the instance is set to *Error* status as well. When the instance is restarted, the session status remains in *Error* and it is not possible to stream from the instance again.
* [LP 2084897](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2084897) Null pointer exception when opening Anbox IME.
* [LP 2072496](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2072496) Setting user data while creating an instance with streaming enabled creates an instance but does not allow you to join the session.
* [LP 2085098](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2085098) The dashboard fails to connect to the stream gateway because the value of the `ASG_API_URL` configuration is used to limit the dashboard's communication. So when the CORS header is set to, for example, the private address of the gateway, the dashboard cannot connect to the gateway.
* [LP 2084800](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2084800) The `no_wait` query parameter for the `POST /1.0/instances` endpoint is not documented.
* [LP 2084120](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2084120) Anbox WebRTC Data Proxy service takes too long to get started.
* [LP 2083795](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2083795) When reconnecting to the ADB server, the connection is refused.
* [LP 2077638](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2077638) After initialising the Anbox Cloud Appliance, the output of `amc image list` remains empty. This shows that the Anbox Management Service (AMS) has not loaded the image list immediately after the initialisation.
* [LP 2084253](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2084253) 64-bit only detection on ARM systems does not work and causes a boot failure.
