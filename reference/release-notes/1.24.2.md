## Deprecations

There are no new deprecations announced for 1.24.2. For the list of features or components that were deprecated earlier and are planned to be removed in future releases, see [deprecation notices](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/deprecation-notices/).

## Known issues

The following are known issues with the 1.24.2 release and we are working towards fixing them for the next release:

* The [out-of-band v2](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/howto/stream/exchange-oob-data/) feature does not work when VM images are in use because of strict system hardening security directives. These directives cause the `anbox-webrtc-data-proxy` unit to fail to start. For more information, see [LP 2093887](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2093887).
* The [Android security bulletin](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-01-01) does not have all the security patch details. So we are unable to validate if all the patches are included in our current release. The CVE section lists as much detail as possible to identify the details of included patches.
