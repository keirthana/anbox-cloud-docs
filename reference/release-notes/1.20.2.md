## Bugs fixed
* Automotive audio control service (`android.hardware.automotive.audiocontrol`) gets launched by accident with the currently provided images.<!--AC-2199-->
* LXD error `NonReusableSucceeded` is not handled properly, causing the application creation to proceed without issues even when the post-stop hook of an addon fails to execute. <!--AC-2212-->
* System security updates for instances are applied even when the corresponding AMS configuration was set to explicitly disable them. <!--AC-2122-->
* With all Android versions, screen recording from the quick settings fails to start.<!--AC-2180-->

* [LP #2046348](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2046348) When dynamically changing the screen resolution upon joining a streaming session to a lower resolution than the configured resolution, the resolution of the resulting video stream does not match. Instead, it stays at the resolution initially configured for the streaming session.<!--AC-2188-->
* [Bug report](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/enable-webgl-in-anbox-cloud/41170/4) When running WebGL based applications, the WebView shows an error and indicates that the WebView APK shipped as part of the Android image does not support WebGL.<!--AC-2214-->
