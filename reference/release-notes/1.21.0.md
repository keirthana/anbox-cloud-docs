# Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.21.0.

Please see {ref}`ref-component-versions` for a list of updated components.

## New features & improvements

The 1.21.0 release of Anbox Cloud brings the following features and improvements:

### Core stack improvements

* Android Automotive (AAOS) images with experimental VHAL support are available. See [Provided images](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/reference/provided-images) for more details.
* Initial support for installing Anbox Cloud Appliance on Ubuntu 24.04.<!--AC-2229-->
* Production support for Vulkan on NVIDIA GPUs is available but remains opt-in. Support must be explicitly enabled and set up. For instructions on enabling the VirGL rendering path for Vulkan support, see [How to enable VirGL](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/anbox/enable-virgl).<!--AC-2152-->

  This release also provides [Renderdoc](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc) support for debugging purposes. See [Graphics debugging with renderdoc](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/android/graphics-debugging-with-renderdoc) for more information. <!--AC-2093-->
* The NVIDIA UDA driver variant with version 545 or later can be installed with the Anbox Cloud Appliance by using the `nvidia-driver-series` and `use-nvidia-uda-driver` flags with the `anbox-cloud-appliance init` command.  <!--AC-2259-->
* GL Async swap support is disabled by default. See {ref}`sec-gl-async-swap` for more information.<!--AC-2228-->
* In the [AMS HTTP API](https://canonical.github.io/anbox-cloud.github.com/latest/ams/), `/1.0` endpoint exposes the cluster ID and name to enable identifying a subcluster.<!--AC-2148-->
* The [Anbox Cloud NFS operator](https://github.com/canonical/anbox-cloud-nfs-operator) charm now supports mounting EFS file system on AWS when you require Transport Layer Security (TLS). With an EFS file system, you can [configure](https://github.com/canonical/anbox-cloud-nfs-operator/blob/main/config.yaml) the charm with the following parameters:<!--AC-2119/2001-->
  - `mount_type` set to `efs`
  - `nfs_extra_options` set to `tls`
* The Anbox Application Registry(AAR) can make use of Identity and Access Management(IAM) roles applied to an AWS instance using instance profiles. This relieves you from having to configure an access key/secret for instances. For information on how to use an IAM role in AAR, see [how to deploy AAR](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/aar/deploy). <!--AC-2025/1700-->
* The NATS charm is switched from its [older version](https://charmhub.io/nats-charmers-nats) to a [newer version](https://charmhub.io/nats) on Charmhub. This would require that you switch to the new charm source. For more information, see {ref}`howto-upgrade-anbox-cloud`.

### Dashboard improvements

The following improvements are available in the Anbox Cloud dashboard for this release:

* Launching an instance independent of a session is now possible using the Anbox Cloud dashboard.  This is especially useful for situations where you want to create an instance but do not want to stream anything. To do this, select the *Create Instance* button on the *Instances* view, provide the information required for instance creation and select *Create and Start*.
* Support multiple subclusters from the dashboard for large scale deployments.
* Client side upscaling is now available as an experimental feature.You can now add `upscaling` as a query parameter to your session URL. For example, `http://<ip_address_of_instance>/sessions/<session_ID>?upscaling=true`.
* Experimental support for managing the [Vehicle Hardware Abstraction Layer (VHAL)](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/vhal) properties for [AAOS](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/start/what_automotive) images.
* Enhancements for improved responsiveness, error handling and messages
* Updated Python and Javascript dependencies.

### Other

* Android security updates for February 2024 (see [Android Security Bulletin - February 2024](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-02-01) for more information).<!--AC-2249-->
* The Android WebView has been updated to [121.0.6167.143](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/01/chrome-for-android-update_0251787784.html).

## Removed functionality

* Clustering support (which existed as an experimental feature) for Anbox Cloud Appliance is removed.<!--AC-2176-->
* The deprecated Android 11 images are now unsupported and hence removed.<!--AC-2108-->

## Known issues

* [LP 2053106](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2053106) In the Anbox Cloud dashboard, selecting the *Download all* button to download all logs from an instance in *Error* state displays a *Page not found (404)* error.<!--AC-2284-->

## Bug fixes

* `Invalid session` error When streaming an audio-only WebRTC session.<!--AC-2256-->
* Initialising Anbox Cloud Appliance as root user causes a `missing AMC client cert` error. <!--AC-2255-->
* [LP 2049734](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2049734) `INSTANCE_TYPE` is set to `regular` instead of `base` during the runtime of the post-stop hook of an addon.<!--AC-2238-->
* When using the web dashboard for application creation, changing the container/VM radio button from one option to another causes a spurious error about the image not being of type `string`. This error occurs only when there is no default container image present.<!--AC-2178-->
* When using the [AMS HTTP API](https://canonical.github.io/anbox-cloud.github.com/latest/ams/), the API response for `GET /1.0/instances` does not properly return information for the fields `config` and `resources`. <!--AC-2156-->
* Video decoder is not considered inactive when initialisation fails. <!--AC-2071-->
* Concurrent stop operations on the same instance occurs due to mixed responsibilities in two internal AMS components.<!--AC-2167-->
