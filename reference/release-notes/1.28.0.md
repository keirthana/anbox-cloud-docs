# 1.28.0

These release notes cover new features and changes in Anbox Cloud 1.28.0.

Anbox Cloud 1.28.0 is a minor release. To understand minor and patch releases, see [Release notes](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/release-notes/release-notes).

Please see [Component versions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/component-versions/) for a list of updated components.

## Requirements

See the [Requirements](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/requirements/) for details on general and deployment specific requirements to run Anbox Cloud.

## New features & improvements

### Authentication and authorization

1.28.0 brings stable release of OIDC based authentication and authorization for both web and command line clients. You can create identities, authorization groups and assign specific permissions to them using the `amc auth` commands.

These guides will help you understand authentication and authorization in Anbox Cloud: `an explanation <exp-auth>`on identities and groups , `a reference list <ref-auth>` of entitlements that can be assigned to identities and groups , `a how-to guide <howto-auth>` to configure user permissions.

### Telephony support

Simulation of incoming SMS messages with notifications are now possible with the Anbox runtime HTTP API. See {ref}`our how-to guide <howto-simulate-incoming-sms>` for detailed instructions.

### Delete protection for instances

Anbox instances can now be protected against accidental deletion. In the dashboard, you can enable this during instance creation or on the *Instance details* page > *Security* section. Once enabled, the instance cannot be deleted even during bulk delete actions until the configuration is reset.

### ADB share management

You can now add and manage up to five ADB shares using the dashboard. To connect to an ADB share, we had `anbox-connect` so far. Now, we also have the `amc connect` command as an alternative.

### Diagnostics and troubleshooting

This release, we have introduced a diagnostic facility in the dashboard for troubleshooting issues with instances and streaming. See {ref}`sec-bug-report` for more information on these files.

### Sensor support

The Anbox Streaming SDK has support for gyroscope, accelerometer and orientation sensors with this release. Support for sensors is disabled by default and needs to be enabled explicitly in your streaming client:

```
...
sensor: {
    enableGyroscope: true
    enableAccelerometer: true
    enableOrientation: true
}
...
```

### Other

* The Android WebView has been updated to [142.0.7444.48](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/10/chrome-beta-for-android-update_22.html).

## Deprecations

The [Anbox Cloud](https://charmhub.io/anbox-cloud) and [Anbox Cloud Core](https://charmhub.io/anbox-cloud-core)  bundles are deprecated and will be unsupported starting from 1.30.0.

## Removed functionality

* Support for the [AMS node controller charm](https://charmhub.io/ams-node-controller) is removed in 1.28.0. The `ams-lxd` charm will install the AMS node controller going forward.
